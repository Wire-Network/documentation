# Wire Network

## The First Universal Transaction Layer

---

## Introduction

Wire is a Universal Transaction Layer that enables all crypto assets and wallets to interact with smart contracts in a single blockchain. In the UTL, transactions are not subject to protocol gas fees and external address formats resolve to a human-readable namespace.

## Manifesto

We believe only systems that enable individual sovereignty will survive.

With time, all centralized systems become corrupt—be they institutions, economies, or the internet. And while the third generation of the internet has brought opportunity, that opportunity has exposed faults that put digital autonomy at risk.

The original promise of blockchain was decentralization—but few platforms are truly decentralized. Trades require you exit decentralized space to validate with an outside entity. DApps are built on centralized hardware. Ledgers are hosted by big three providers. These systems are dependent on third-party trust—and thus will not last. The system as we know it is dead.

But the future of the internet is ours for shaping. The market is hungry for a meaningful alternative solution, one where trustless compute and true blockchain interoperability are a reality. In this system, universal, trustless standards are available and accessible; protocol demands accountability; and individual sovereignty is open-source.

Because the next generation of the internet is trustless—if we build it.

## Wire Development Principles

- **Zero trust can be involved.**

Similar to bitcoin, Wire Network is designed and built to be completely secure and decentralized, and therefore, we cannot introduce any elements deviate from these principles.

- **Scalability is a must.**

Wire Network must always have a path to scale to support more and more users, so developers must avoid any elements that could bottleneck the system.

- **User Control of Private Keys.**

All applications and decentralized applications (dApps) on the network must operate in a non-custodial manner. This ensures that users maintain exclusive control over their private keys.

- **Limited On-Chain Data.**

No storage of any personally identifying information on the blockchain, with the sole exception of data necessary for council nominations. We are dedicated to minimizing exposure to privacy risks and adhering to best practices in data protection.

- **Enforcing UTXO for Secure Transactions.**

It is mandatory for all apps to utilize the UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) model when processing transactions. This reinforces our dedication to strong security measures, making each transaction verifiable and consistent.
